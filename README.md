# Stallings_HW6_Fundamental_Matrix

This is my final submission for Sensor Fusion and Perception Assignment 6: Compute Fundamental Matrix. 
The code can be found at: https://github.com/nastallings/Stallings_HW6_Fundamental_Matrix

The file main.py needs to be run for the code to work. The file will output a figure that plots the points and epipolar lines. It will also print out the F matrix. 
A dataset of images is available to use. The current images output the figure output.png and the following fundemntal matrix:

 [[ 6.92770525e-06 -5.47563680e-05  2.36633473e-02]
 [ 6.36950335e-05  1.05569457e-05  1.89671950e-02]
 [-2.73480411e-02 -2.81978687e-02  1.00000000e+00]]
